## Stars With Lars Notes
These are the notes from Lars Bildsten's course on Stellar Structure and
Evolution, often lovingly referred to as Stars with Lars (PHYS 232 in the UCSB
Physics department graduate curriculum). They were originally taken by Bill
Wolf during the winter quarter of 2012, and they were futher refined when the
class was again taught in the fall quarter of 2013.

#### Special Thanks
Obviously, thanks to Lars Bildsten for teaching a wonderful course. Also thanks
to guest lecturers Kevin Moore, Matteo Cantiello, and Ben Brown. In particular,
Ben Brown covered the rotation topics at the end of the notes that are not
typically taught in the course.

Additional thanks to Matt Coleman and other members of the 2012 cohort who
helped edit the notes (and delayed the erasing of blackboards when I was late to
class).

#### Usage
These notes are meant for personal usage only. Feel free to study them for your
own understanding, and please let the author know if there are mistakes. If you
would like to base a class off of these or use them for some other more
offficial purpose, please contact the author, Bill Wolf
(wmwolf@physics.ucsb.edu), who will then talk to Lars Bildsten about any such
usage.
